# StudentPerformanceAnalysis
This dataset contains information about student performance in two subjects: Mathematics and Portuguese language.
It includes various attributes related to students' demographic information, family background, study habits, and academic performance.
The dataset comprises 395 student records for Mathematics and 649 for Portuguese, with a total of 33 attributes for each student.
I have chosen the Mathematics dataset, which consists of 395 student records and 33 attributes per student, allowing for an in-depth analysis of factors that influence math performance.
